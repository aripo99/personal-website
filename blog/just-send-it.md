### just send it

If there’s one thing I want to take from this year, it’s to stop being scared and just send it. To follow my heart, do what feels right, and put my whole soul into it. The hope is that it will work out, but even if it doesn’t, at least I tried—and that’s enough.

Obviously, it’s life, and I don’t take it lightly. But I feel like I’ve been playing it safe, and I’m done with that. At least for a few years while I’m young, I want to push myself and see what I’m capable of. So far, every time I’ve followed my heart, I’ve ended up happy about it eventually, and while that might not always be the case, it’s still a strong signal.

Anyway, this one’s short, but I want to keep it here to read whenever I need it. I’d be pretty disappointed if my heart tells me something and I don’t just _send it_ :)

### Hapiness

Every once in a while I end up thinking about what makes me happy. I obviously don't have a definitive answer, otherwise I would be happy all the time (i'm not lol). But I do have some thoughts on the question. 

Family brings me happiness. Friends do too, as you might have guessed from the fact that I dedicated an entire blog post to them. The small, everyday things bring me joy—like going for a run on a beautiful day, having a great workout session, lounging in the park, reading a good book, learning something new, or just enjoying a casual BBQ.

Being at peace is also one of the most important things for me. At peace with my decisions, knowing that I did my best and acted in the best way possible, even if the outcome wasn't what I expected. Aknowledging that I also did mistakes, but promising myself to learn from them and not repeat them. Doing good also makes me happy, feeling that I'm being useful in some way, no matter how small that way is.

I also think about what doesn't make me happy. I don't like being useless, or even worse feeling that I'm substracting instead of adding. Buying stuff that I don't need does not make me happy either, but, you know... the other day I bought a pretty cool shirt :p Partying does not make me happy either, though it's quite fun to go out with friends sometimes.

That last point leads me to a recurring thought: the distinction between pleasure and happiness. My experience is that short-term pleasure will not lead to happiness. I think that's quite important because without differentiating these two I end up confusing them. But happiness is much nicer, it's almost like a state of mind where you feel at comfort and peace. You obviously have bad moments but you end up coming back to that state of mind.

I’ll leave this open-ended for now, so I can return and add more thoughts later. It's nice to think about this though because I feel like sometimes we do things in search of happiness even though we know deep down that they won't make us happy.
